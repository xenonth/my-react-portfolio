## Purpose
A more advanced portfolio to demonstrate my ability using React.js as well as promote my other projects for interested employers. 

## Layout and Features
Everything is broken down into the following categories components, data files, and sections/'pages'. Components are the templates to plug in desired information.  There are two Card components layout Intro for the about me section and projects layout for displaying all information required about the projects.  The projects card also configured of a hover effect where the intended design was to on hover have the current image dissapear to have another image appear.  Replacement effect was a struggle so I settled on utilising state to show an image of the project appear underneath the existing image.   Lastly are the Sections/pages which is the single page's subparts which was necessary for the internal link's to scroll to desired point which is the starting card(s) of that section.

The original design was going to be like my previous portfolio site but it proved to be more convenient to setup everything on a single webpage.
